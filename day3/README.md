## Part 1
Use the test input to find "part numbers". Something is a part number if there is a symbol (other than a `.`) adjacent to it (including diagonally). Find all the numbers that are part numbers and add them together to get the total.

### Example
```
467..114..
...*......
..35..633.
......#...
617*......
.....+.58.
..592.....
......755.
...$.*....
.664.598..
```
Part Numbers - `[467, 35, 633, 617, 592, 755, 664, 598]`
Output - `467 + 35 + 633 + 617 + 592 + 755 + 664 + 598` or `4361`
